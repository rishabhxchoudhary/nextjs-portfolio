In this blog, I will be discussing about various Overlapping Interval Problems and how we can solve them.

Interval overlapping problems in competitive programming involve manipulating intervals (ranges) and determining if they overlap with each other. The goal is to design an efficient algorithm to solve these problems.

The general idea to solve interval overlapping problems is to sort the intervals based on their start or end points and then traverse them to identify the overlaps. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Input the intervals: Each interval is typically represented as a pair of start and end points, such as (start, end) or [start, end].

Sort the intervals: Depending on the problem requirements, you may need to sort the intervals based on their start points or end points. Sorting helps in identifying overlapping intervals efficiently.

Traverse the intervals: After sorting, traverse the intervals one by one to detect overlaps. You can use a loop or iterate through the sorted list of intervals.

Check for overlaps: During the traversal, compare the current interval's end point with the next interval's start point. If the end point of the current interval is greater than or equal to the start point of the next interval, it indicates an overlap.

Handle overlaps: Depending on the problem requirements, you may need to perform specific actions when overlaps are detected. This could involve merging the overlapping intervals, counting the number of overlaps, or any other required operation.

Continue traversal: Move to the next interval and repeat steps 4 and 5 until all intervals are processed.

By following this general approach, you can efficiently solve interval overlapping problems in competitive programming. However, the specific implementation details may vary depending on the problem statement and requirements.

Maximum Number of Overlapping Intervals: Find the maximum number of intervals that overlap with each other.

Maximum Subset of Non-Overlapping Intervals: Find the largest subset of intervals that do not overlap with each other.

Minimum Number of Intervals to Remove: Determine the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to make all intervals non-overlapping.

Merge Overlapping Intervals: Merge intervals that overlap with each other into a consolidated set of non-overlapping intervals.

Interval Intersection: Find the intersection (common region) of two or more intervals.

Interval Union: Find the union (combined region) of two or more intervals.

Interval Scheduling: Schedule a set of intervals on a limited resource (e.g., a processor, meeting rooms) to maximize resource utilization or minimize conflicts.

Interval Partitioning: Divide a set of intervals into a minimum number of disjoint subsets, where no intervals in the same subset overlap.

Interval Coloring: Assign colors to a set of intervals such that no two overlapping intervals have the same color.

Interval Covering: Find the smallest set of intervals that cover a given range or set of points.
