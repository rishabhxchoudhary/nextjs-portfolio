about: "Discover the power of the Sparse Table, a highly efficient data structure for answering range queries on static arrays. This blog explores its applications in solving frequent range queries, such as finding the minimum, maximum, sum, or any other associative operation over a subarray. With a preprocessing time complexity of O(n log n) and an impressive O(1) time complexity for range queries, the Sparse Table is a valuable tool in scenarios where the array is static or undergoes infrequent changes. Enhance your understanding of this data structure to excel in interviews and competitive programming challenges."

# Sparse Table: A Powerful Data Structure for Efficient Range Queries

- The Sparse Table is a data structure used to efficiently answer range queries on a static array. 
- It is used for frequent range queries, such as finding the minimum, maximum, sum, or any other associative operation over a subarray.
- It allows us to perform range queries in O(1) time complexity while having a preprocessing time of O(n log n). 
- This makes it an excellent choice for scenarios where the array is static or changes infrequently.

## **The Sparse Table Basically Stores 2<sup>i</sup>-th Parent of Nodes**

- Let's try to construct a Sparse Table for the following Binary Tree.

*We can see that*
- Node 1 is root hence it has no parent. Let default parent be 0.
- Node 2 and 3 have 1st parent as 1 and 2nd parent 0.
- Node 4 and 5 have 1st parent as 2 and 2nd parent as 1 and 4th parent as 0.
- Node 6 1st parent as 3 and 2nd parent as 1 and 4th parent as 0.
- Node 7 and 8 have 1st parent as 4 and 2nd parent as 2 and 4th parent as 0.

*Basically we want to look at 2<sup>i</sup>-th parent of every node and store it in a table.*

- Hence the Sparce Table for this Binary Tree will look like :

## Coding Sparse Table

<p>We can use Dynamic Programming to Code Sparse Table</p>
<p>
Recurrence Relation is given as :
</p>
<code>
    Parent[cur][j] = Parent[ Parent[cur][j-1] ][j-1]
</code>

### Python Code :
```Python:
class Sparse_Table:
    def __init__(self, graph: dict):
        self.M = int(math.log2(len(graph)+3) + 2)
        self.parent = [[0]*self.M for _ in range(len(graph)+3)]
        self.depth = [0]*(len(graph)+3)
        self.dfs(graph)

    def dfs(self, graph: dict):
        def dfs1(curr: int, par: int):
            self.parent[curr][0] = par
            self.depth[curr] = self.depth[par] + 1
            for j in range(1, self.M):
                self.parent[curr][j] = self.parent[self.parent[curr][j-1]][j-1]
            for child in graph[curr]:
                if child != par:
                    dfs1(child, curr)
        dfs1(1, 0)
```

## Common Applications of Sparce Table

- **Range Minimum/Maximum Query (RMQ):** Sparse tables can be used to solve the RMQ problem efficiently. They can answer queries for finding the minimum or maximum value in a given range of an array in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing, where n is the size of the array.

```Python:
import math

class RMQ:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.arr = arr
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.lookup = [[0 for i in range(self.n)] for j in range(self.n)]
        self.buildSparseTable()

    def buildSparseTable(self):
        for i in range(0, self.n):
            self.lookup[i][0] = self.arr[i]
        j = 1
        while (1 << j) <= self.n:
            i = 0
            while (i + (1 << j) - 1) < self.n:
                if self.lookup[i][j - 1] < self.lookup[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1]:
                    self.lookup[i][j] = self.lookup[i][j - 1]
                else:
                    self.lookup[i][j] = self.lookup[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1]
                i += 1
            j += 1

    def query(self, L, R):
        j = int(math.log2(R - L + 1))
        if self.lookup[L][j] <= self.lookup[R - (1 << j) + 1][j]:
            return self.lookup[L][j]
        else:
            return self.lookup[R - (1 << j) + 1][j]
```

- **Range Sum Query (RSQ)**: Sparse tables can also be used to solve the RSQ problem, which involves finding the sum of elements in a given range of an array. They can answer queries for range sums in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing.

- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: Sparse tables can be applied to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. By precomputing information about the tree, sparse tables can answer LCA queries in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing.
```Python:
class LCA:
    def __init__(self, graph: dict):
        self.table = Sparse_Table(graph)

    # Returns the LCA of Nodes U and V
    def getLCA(self, u: int, v: int):
        if self.table.depth[u] < self.table.depth[v]:
            u, v = v, u
        diff = self.table.depth[u] - self.table.depth[v]
        for i in range(self.table.M-1, -1, -1):
            if (diff >> i) & 1:
                u = self.table.parent[u][i]
        if u == v:
            return u
        for i in range(self.table.M-1, -1, -1):
            if self.table.parent[u][i] != self.table.parent[v][i]:
                u = self.table.parent[u][i]
                v = self.table.parent[v][i]
        return self.table.parent[u][0]

    Returns the Distance between U and V
    def dist(self, u: int, v: int):
        return self.table.depth[u] + self.table.depth[v] - 2*self.table.depth[self.getLCA(u, v)]
```

- **Range Mode Query**: Sparse tables can be extended to find the mode (most frequent element) in a given range of an array efficiently. By storing additional information during preprocessing, sparse tables can answer mode queries in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing.


- **Range GCD/LCM Query**: Sparse tables can be used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) or least common multiple (LCM) of a given range of elements in an array. They can answer GCD/LCM queries in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing.
```Python:
import math

class Range_GCD_Query:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.arr = arr
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.lookup = [[0 for i in range(self.n)] for j in range(self.n)]
        self.buildSparseTable()

    def buildSparseTable(self):
        for i in range(0, self.n):
            self.lookup[i][0] = self.arr[i]
        j = 1
        while (1 << j) <= self.n:
            i = 0
            while (i + (1 << j) - 1) < self.n:
                self.lookup[i][j] = math.gcd(
                    self.lookup[i][j - 1], self.lookup[i + (1 << (j - 1))][j - 1])
                i += 1
            j += 1

    def query(self, L, R):
        j = int(math.log2(R - L + 1))
        return math.gcd(self.lookup[L][j], self.lookup[R - (1 << j) + 1][j])
```

- **Range Kth Smallest/Largest Query**: Sparse tables can be employed to find the Kth smallest or largest element in a given range of an array. By storing additional information during preprocessing, sparse tables can answer Kth smallest/largest queries in O(1) time after O(n log n) preprocessing.
