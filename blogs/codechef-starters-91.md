# Problem 1 : [Blobby Volley Scores](https://www.codechef.com/START91B/problems/BLOBBYVOLLEY)

- This is a very basic Problem and can be solved by *brute force*.


My Solution:
```Python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    A_is_server = True
    A_score = 0
    B_score = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == "A":
            if A_is_server:
                A_score += 1
            else:
                A_is_server = True
        else:
            if A_is_server:
                A_is_server = False
            else:
                B_score += 1
    print(A_score, B_score)
```

# Problem 2 : [Odd GCD Permutation](https://www.codechef.com/START91B/problems/NAS_2523)
Problem : We want to find Permutation of {1,2,3,...,N} such that GCD(P1, P3,...) > GCD(P2,P4...).

**Observation :**
1. GCD(1,x) = 1. It means that GCD of any number and 1 will always be 1.
2. Since GCD(1,x) is always 1, hence 1 cannot be on an Odd place.


- It is not hard to see now that all even numbers will be on odd places and vice versa.

- If n is odd then if is never possible to make such a Permutation.

- Now try to make the lexologically largest Permutation.

My solution :
```Python:
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    if n & 1:
        print(-1)
        continue
    else:
        for i in reversed(range(1, n+1, 2)):
            print(i+1, i, end=" ")
        print()
```

# Problem 3 : [Chef Odd](https://www.codechef.com/START91B/problems/CHEFODD)
### Probelm Statement :
- Given N and K, determine whether itâ€™s possible to partition the integers {1,2,3...N} into exactly K groups such that:
- Each group contains atleast 2 integers.
- The sum of each group is odd.

### Observations:

1. Let n be an Even number 
We know that Odd+Odd = Even and Even+Even = Odd. 

Hence We can only club Odd and Even numbers together.

if n=6:

1 2 3 4 5 6 => (1,2) (3,4) (5,6) 

Hence the maximum number of subsets if n/2; or ceil of n/2 (if n is odd)

But if N is odd, the it cannot be n/2 as minimum number of elements in each subset is 2.

Also Odd+odd+odd = Odd.
Hence if We can form 5 subsets => 0dd+0dd+0dd+0dd+0dd ==> We can also form 3 subsets => 0dd+0dd+0dd => We can also form 1 subset.

My Solution:
```Python:
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = (n+1) >> 1
    if n & 1:
        if k == x:
            print("NO")
            continue
    if k > x:
        print("NO")
        continue
    if x & 1:
        if k & 1:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
    else:
        if k & 1:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")

# Problem 4 : [Maximum Sum Permutatition](https://www.codechef.com/START91B/problems/MAXSUMPERM)

### Editorial :

- Brute for approach that I thought of was, We can initialize an X =  array of every element 0 , and for every query $L_i$ and $R_i$ we can add +1 for all elements in this range.
- Once this is done. I can assign the largest elements to indexes with Decreasing values in X.
- Hence we can find the permutations.
  

- -> The Tricky Part is that we have to Process the queries faster.
- Whenever we add +1 from L to R, all elements in X changes.
  
- Lets define a difference array  $$D_i = X_i - X_i-1$$

- For every query, [L,R] => D[L-1]+=1 and D[R+1]+=1.
- X can be recovered for this difference array by taking prefix sum of D.

- My solution:
```Python:
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    d = [0]*(n)
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        d[l-1] += 1
        if r < n:
            d[r] -= 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        d[i] += d[i-1]
    indexes = list(range(n))
    indexes.sort(key=lambda x: d[x])
    ans = [0]*n
    x = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans[indexes[i]] = a[i]
        x += a[i]*d[indexes[i]]
    print(x)
    print(*ans)
```

# Problem 5 : [XOR & Sum](https://www.codechef.com/problems/XOR_EQ_SUM)

### PROBLEM:

Given $L$ and $R$, find the number of integers $x$ such that there exist $L \leq a \leq b \leq R$ satisfying $a+b = a\oplus b = x$.

## Editorial

if $a + b = a\oplus b$ means that i.e, a & b = 0. 

### Subtask 1
- Can be done by Brute Force, using 2 loops in $O(n^2)$


### Subtask 2
- if $L=0$ and $R = 2^k -1$, (i.e all bits = 1) then by observation, ans if $R+1$, i.e. Length of the range of [L,R]
- it means that x will take all values in the range $[L,R]$.

### Subtask 3
- Now R can be anything and $L=0$
- Just check the most significant bit (let k) of R, i.e closest power of 2 
- Answer will be $2^k$

### Subtask 4 and 5
- Now we have no constraints on L and R.
- Check the most significant bit of R.
- now as $L!=0$, X might be less than L.
- We can find all power of 2 in the range $[L,R]$
- For every power of 2 (let x), add $x-L$ to answer variable.

Code:
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

int main(){
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--){
        ll l, r;
        cin >> l >> r;
        ll ans = 0;
        if (l == 0) ans++;
        for (int i = 0; i < 66; i++){
            ll x = (1LL << i);
            if (x > r) break;
            if (x < l) continue;
            ans += x - l;
        }
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
