Planarity Testing: Planarity testing algorithms determine if a graph can be embedded in a plane without any edge intersections. They are used in circuit design, graph visualization, and network layout.

All-Pairs Shortest Paths: Algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall or Johnson's algorithm compute the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph. They are useful for scenarios where you need to determine the shortest paths between all nodes in a graph.

Strongly Connected Components (SCC): SCC algorithms, like Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithm, identify groups of nodes in a directed graph where each node can reach every other node in the group. SCCs are useful in analyzing network connectivity, finding bottlenecks, or clustering.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Algorithms: DAG algorithms solve problems specific to directed acyclic graphs. Examples include topological sorting, longest path in a DAG, or finding the number of paths between two vertices.

Graph Isomorphism: Graph isomorphism algorithms determine if two graphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure despite different labels on the vertices. Graph isomorphism has applications in pattern recognition, cryptography, and data compression.

Centrality Measures: Centrality algorithms, such as Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, or PageRank, quantify the importance or influence of nodes in a graph. These measures are useful in social network analysis, recommendation systems, or identifying key nodes in networks.

Graph Partitioning: Graph partitioning algorithms aim to divide a graph into multiple subgraphs while minimizing the number of edges between different subgraphs. It is used in parallel computing, load balancing, or network clustering.

Graph Compression: Graph compression algorithms aim to represent a graph using fewer resources or a more compact representation while preserving its essential properties. This is beneficial for efficient storage, transmission, or processing of large graphs.

Graph Matching: Graph matching algorithms compare two graphs and determine the similarity or correspondence between their vertices or edges. It has applications in image recognition, pattern matching, or biological sequence analysis.

Graph Visualization: Graph visualization algorithms create visually appealing representations of graphs to aid in understanding and analysis. They focus on arranging the vertices and edges in a way that reveals patterns, structures, or relationships in the graph.
